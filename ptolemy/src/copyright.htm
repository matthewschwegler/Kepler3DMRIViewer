        <a name="section0">
</a>0. Additional Definitions.
      </h4>
      <p>
        As used herein, &#8220;this License&#8221; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser 
        General Public License, and the &#8220;GNU GPL&#8221; refers to version 3 of the 
        GNU General Public License.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#8220;The Library&#8221; refers to a covered work governed by this License, other 
        than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
      </p>
      <p>
        An &#8220;Application&#8221; is any work that makes use of an interface provided 
        by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. 
        Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode 
        of using an interface provided by the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        A &#8220;Combined Work&#8221; is a work produced by combining or linking an 
        Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library 
        with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &#8220;Linked 
        Version&#8221;.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &#8220;Minimal Corresponding Source&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
        Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code 
        for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are 
        based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &#8220;Corresponding Application Code&#8221; for a Combined Work means the 
        object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data 
        and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the 
        Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="section1">
</a>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
      </h4>
      <p>
        You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License 
        without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a name="section2">
</a>2. Conveying Modified Versions.
      </h4>
      <p>
        If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a 
        facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application 
        that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the 
        facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified 
        version:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to 
          ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the 
          function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever 
          part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
        </li>
        <li>
          b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of 
          this License applicable to that copy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        <a name="section3">
</a>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a 
        header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object 
        code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated 
        material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure 
        layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates 
        (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the 
          Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered 
          by this License.
        </li>
        <li>
          b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this 
          license document.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        <a name="section4">
</a>4. Combined Works.
      </h4>
      <p>
        You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken 
        together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of 
        the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for 
        debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that 
          the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
          covered by this License.
        </li>
        <li>
          b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this 
          license document.
        </li>
        <li>
          c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during 
          execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these 
          notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of 
          the GNU GPL and this license document.
        </li>
        <li>
          d) Do one of the following:

          <ul>
            <li>
              0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of 
              this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form 
              suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine 
              or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked 
              Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner 
              specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying 
              Corresponding Source.
            </li>
            <li>
              1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the 
              Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a 
              copy of the Library already present on the user's computer 
              system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of 
              the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise 
          be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU 
          GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to 
          install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced 
          by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version 
          of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation 
          Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and 
          Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must 
          provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by 
          section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

        You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
        side by side in a single library together with other library 
        facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this 
        License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your 
        choice, if you do both of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based 
          on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, 
          conveyed under the terms of this License.
        </li>
        <li>
          b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it 
          is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the 
          accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

</a>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
        of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new 
        versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may 
        differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
        as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the 
        GNU Lesser General Public License &#8220;or any later version&#8221; applies to 
        it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either 
        of that published version or of any later version published by the 
        Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not 
        specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you 
        may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever 
        published by the Free Software Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide 
        whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall 
        apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is 
        permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

    <h2>
      GNU General Public License
    </h2>
    <p>
      Version 2, June 1991
    </p>
    <h3>
      Preamble
    </h3>
    <p>
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
      share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is 
      intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to 
      make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public 
      License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and 
      to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free 
      Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General 
      Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
      freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
      service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
      want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new 
      free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone 
      to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
      restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
      distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis 
      or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. 
      You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. 
      And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
      (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
      distribute and/or modify the software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
      that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
      software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
      want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 
      that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
      authors' reputations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
      We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
      individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
      proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must 
      be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
      modification follow.
    </p>
    <h3>
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    </h3>
    <ol start="0">
      <li>
        <p>
          This License applies to any program or other work which contains a 
          notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed 
          under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, 
          below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the 
          Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under 
          copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a 
          portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
          translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is 
          included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each 
          licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
          covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of 
          running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the 
          Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on 
          the Program (independent of having been made by running the 
          Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source 
          code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
          conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
          copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the 
          notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
          warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of 
          this License along with the Program.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, 
          and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for 
          a fee.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of 
          it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and 
          distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
          above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices 
            stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in 
            whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any 
            part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third 
            parties under the terms of this License.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
            run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive 
            use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement 
            including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there 
            is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and 
            that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, 
            and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. 
            (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not 
            normally print such an announcement, your work based on the 
            Program is not required to print an announcement.)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
          identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, 
          and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
          themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
          sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
          distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work 
          based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the 
          terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend 
          to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of 
          who wrote it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or 
          contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the 
          intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of 
          derivative or collective works based on the Program.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the 
          Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a 
          volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other 
          work under the scope of this License.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, 
          under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms 
          of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the 
          following:
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
            source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 
            1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software 
            interchange; or,
          </li>
          <li>
            Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, 
            to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of 
            physically performing source distribution, a complete 
            machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be 
            distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
            customarily used for software interchange; or,
          </li>
          <li>
            Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
            distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed 
            only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the 
            program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in 
            accord with Subsection b above.)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
          making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source 
          code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
          associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to 
          control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as 
          a special exception, the source code distributed need not include 
          anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary 
          form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
          operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
          itself accompanies the executable.
        </p>
        <p>
          If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering 
          access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
          access to copy the source code from the same place counts as 
          distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not 
          compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
          except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt 
          otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is 
          void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this 
          License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from 
          you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
          long as such parties remain in full compliance.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
          signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
          distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are 
          prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by 
          modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
          Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
          all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
          the Program or works based on it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
          Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
          original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject 
          to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further 
          restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted 
          herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
          parties to this License.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
          infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
          conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
          otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do 
          not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot 
          distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under 
          this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
          consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, 
          if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of 
          the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly 
          through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this 
          License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the 
          Program.

        <p>
          If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable 
          under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is 
          intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in 
          other circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
          patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
          such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
          integrity of the free software distribution system, which is 
          implemented by public license practices. Many people have made 
          generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
          through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
          system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is 
          willing to distribute software through any other system and a 
          licensee cannot impose that choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed 
          to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
          certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, 
          the original copyright holder who places the Program under this 
          License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
          excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in 
          or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License 
          incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this 
          License.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
          of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions 
          will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in 
          detail to address new problems or concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the 
          Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to 
          it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the 
          terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version 
          published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not 
          specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version 
          ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free 
          programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the 
          author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by 
          the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; 
          we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided 
          by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of 
          our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software 
          generally.
        </p>
        <p>
          NO WARRANTY
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY 
          FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT 
          WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER 
          PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
          EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE 
          IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
          PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
          PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME 
          THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

      <li>
        <p>
          IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
          WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY 
          AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU 
          FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 
          CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
          PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 
          RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
          FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF 
          SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
          SUCH DAMAGES.

    <p>
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    </p>
    <h3>
      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest 
      possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it 
      free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these 
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to 
      attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey 
      the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the 
      &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    </p>
    <p>
      one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does. 
      Copyright (C) yyyy name of author
    </p>
    <p>
      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it 
      under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the 
      Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your 
      option) any later version.
    </p>
    <p>
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but 
      WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of 
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General 
      Public License for more details.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along 
      with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 
      59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this 
      when it starts in an interactive mode:
    </p>
    <p>
      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision 
      comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is 
      free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain 
      conditions; type `show c' for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the 
      appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands 
      you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they 
      could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your 
      school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if 
      necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
    </p>
    <p>
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program 
      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
    </p>
    <p>
      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice
    </p>
    <p>
      This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program 
      into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you 
      may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications 
      with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser 
      General Public License instead of this License.

in your Entitlement. If you require additional Licensed Units, you will

is licensed, not sold, to you by Sun. Sun reserves all rights not
expressly granted. (b) You may make a single archival copy of Software,
but otherwise may not copy, modify, or distribute Software. However if

and/or redistributable files, that may be handled differently, you may
do so only as provided in the Sun documentation. (c) You may not rent,
lease, lend or encumber Software. (d) Unless enforcement is prohibited by
applicable law, you may not decompile, or reverse engineer Software. (e)
The terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to any Software

or comparison tests run on Software to any third party without the prior
written consent of Sun. (g) Software is confidential and copyrighted. (h)
Unless otherwise specified, if Software is delivered with embedded or

Software may contain programs that perform automated collection of
system data and/or automated software updating services. System data
collected through such programs may be used by Sun, its subcontractors,
and its service delivery partners for the purpose of providing you with
remote system services and/or improving Sun's software and systems. (j)
Software is not designed, licensed or intended for use in the design,
construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility and Sun
and its licensors disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness
for such uses. (k) No right, title or interest in or to any trademark,
service mark, logo or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted
under this Agreement.

6. Java Compatibility and Open Source.

Software may contain Java technology. You may not create additional
classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under
compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available
at www.java.net.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source
developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions
and open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of
its products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and
open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern
the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not alter
any rights and obligations you may have under such open source licenses,
however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provisions
in this Agreement will apply to all Software in this distribution.

7. Term and Termination.

The license and service term are set forth in your Entitlement(s). Your
rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from
Sun if you materially breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's
and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun may terminate this Agreement
should any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to
become, the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or
trade secret misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use of,
and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun. Sections
1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination of the Agreement.

8. Limited Warranty.

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of
purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which
Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials
and workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is
provided &quot;AS IS&quot;. Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under
this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media
or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not allow limitations
on certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply to you. This
limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others,
which vary from state to state.

9. Disclaimer of Warranty.

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO
BE LEGALLY INVALID.

10. Limitation of Liability.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS
BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS
OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF
OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you,
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental
or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable
to you.

11. Export Regulations.

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials delivered
under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be
subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree
to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that
you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to export, re-export,
or import as may be required after delivery to you.

12. U.S. Government Restricted Rights.

If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or
by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier),
then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation
will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with
48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

13. Governing Law.

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California
law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any
jurisdiction will apply.

14. Severability.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this
Agreement will immediately terminate.

15. Integration.

This Agreement, including any terms contained in your Entitlement, is the
entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. It
supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications,
proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any
conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or
other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter
during the term of this Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will
be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative
of each party.

      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

        </p>
        <p>
          <font size="10pt"><span>Commercial distributors of software may 
          accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business 
          partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate 
          the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the 
          Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner 
          which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. 
          Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial 
          product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby 
          agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified 
          Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively 
          &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions 
          brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the 
          extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial 
          Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a 
          commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not 
          apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged 
          intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an 
          Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial 
          Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial 
          Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial 
          Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. 
          The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its 
          own expense.</span></font>
        </p>
        <p>
          <font size="10pt"><span>For example, a Contributor might include the 
          Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That 
          Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial 
          Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties 
          related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are 
          such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this 
          section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims 
          against the other Contributors related to those performance claims 
          and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay 
          any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those 
          damages.</span></font>

          Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is

          obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by

          rights in Software and accompanying documentation will be only as 
          set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 C.F.R. 
          227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 
          48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

      The &quot;Artistic License&quot;

      <h2>
        Preamble
      </h2>
      The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a 
      Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some 
      semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while 
      giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the 
      Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make 
      reasonable modifications.

      <h3>
        Definitions:
      </h3>
      <p>
        &quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the 
        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created 
        through textual modification.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been 
        modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the 
        Copyright Holder.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights 
        for the package.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;You&quot; is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this 
        Package.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the basis of 
        media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. 
        (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but 
        only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear 
        the fee.)
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, 
        though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means 
        that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same 
        conditions they received it.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the 
          Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that 
          you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated 
          disclaimers.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications 
          derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A 
          Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the 
          Standard Version.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, 
          provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file 
          stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do 
          at least ONE of the following:<br>a) place your modifications in the 
          Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by 
          posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or 
          placing the modifications on a major archive site, or by allowing 
          the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard 
          Version of the Package.<br>b) use the modified Package only within 
          your corporation or organization.<br>c) rename any non-standard 
          executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, 
          which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for 
          each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs 
          from the Standard Version.<br>d) make other distribution 
          arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or 
          executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:<br>a) 
          distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, 
          together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on 
          where to get the Standard Version.<br>b) accompany the distribution 
          with the machine-readable source of the Package with your 
          modifications.<br>c) accompany any non-standard executables with 
          their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the 
          non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting 
          the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with 
          instructions on where to get the Standard Version. d) make other 
          distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this 
          Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this 
          Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, 
          you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly 
          commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) 
          software distribution provided that you do not advertise this 
          Package as a product of your own.
        </li>
        <li>
          The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as 
          output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall 
          under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever 
          generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated 
          with this Package.
        </li>
        <li>
          C or Java subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package 
          shall not be considered part of this Package.

B. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
=======================================================

JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the
primary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw
took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.

In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge
where it was renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 and 2.1 were developed
under the Jython specific license below.

From the 2.2 release on, Jython contributors have signed
Python Software Foundation contributor agreements and releases are
covered under the Python Software Foundation license version 2.

The standard library is covered by the Python Software Foundation
license as well. See the Lib/LICENSE file for details.

The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed
under the GNU Public License.  The package is now covered by the Jython
Software License.

The command line interpreter is covered by the Apache Software
License.  See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details.

      <pre>A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is &quot;not incompatible&quot; with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE 
        PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF 
        THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>1. DEFINITIONS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Contribution&quot; means:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and 
        documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        i) changes to the Program, and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        ii) additions to the Program;
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and 
        are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 
        'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such 
        Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. 
        Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are 
        separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the 
        Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative 
        works of the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor 
        which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution 
        alone or when combined with the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this 
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this 
        Agreement, including all Contributors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</b>
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright 
        license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
        publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such 
        Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and 
        object code form.
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby 
        grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent 
        license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, 
        import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if 
        any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall 
        apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at 
        the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition 
        of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the 
        Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other 
        combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is 
        licensed hereunder.
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the 
        licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are 
        provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the 
        patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each 
        Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by 
        any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights 
        or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses 
        granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility 
        to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For 
        example, if a third party patent license is required to allow 
        Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility 
        to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient 
        copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright 
        license set forth in this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form 
        under its own license agreement, provided that:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) its license agreement:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties 
        and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or 
        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or 
        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability 
        for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and 
        consequential damages, such as lost profits;
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are 
        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such 
        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable 
        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Program is made available in source code form:
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p class="list">
        b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the 
        Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained 
        within the Program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its 
        Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent 
        Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial distributors of software may accept certain 
        responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the 
        like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use 
        of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a 
        commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not 
        create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a 
        Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, 
        such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend 
        and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) 
        against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising 
        from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party 
        against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts 
        or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its 
        distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The 
        obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses 
        relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. 
        In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly 
        notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) 
        allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the 
        Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement 
        negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such 
        claim at its own expense.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial 
        product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial 
        Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance 
        claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance 
        claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility 
        alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to 
        defend claims against the other Contributors related to those 
        performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other 
        Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor 
        must pay those damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5. NO WARRANTY</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS 
        PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY 
        KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY 
        WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY 
        OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely 
        responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and 
        distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its 
        exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to 
        the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable 
        laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and 
        unavailability or interruption of operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR 
        ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, 
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING 
        WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF 
        LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING 
        NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR 
        DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED 
        HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>7. GENERAL</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
        the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further 
        action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the 
        minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity 
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
        the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other 
        software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such 
        Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of 
        the date such litigation is filed.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it 
        fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this 
        Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of 
        time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's 
        rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use 
        and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. 
        However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses 
        granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and 
        survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, 
        but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and 
        may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward 
        reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of 
        this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement 
        Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation 
        is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign 
        the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable 
        separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a 
        distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) 
        may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement 
        under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the 
        Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the 
        Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as 
        expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives 
        no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor 
        under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or 
        otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this 
        Agreement are reserved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and 
        the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No 
        party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement 
        more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives 
        its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

        <a name="SEC2" href="#TOC2">Preamble</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom 
        to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses 
        are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free 
        software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some 
        specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the 
        Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You 
        can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether 
        this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better 
        strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations 
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, 
        not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that 
        you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge 
        for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get 
        it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of 
        it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do 
        these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
        distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these 
        rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for 
        you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis 
        or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave 
        you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source 
        code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide 
        complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them 
        with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling 
        it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the 
        library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal 
        permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there 
        is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified 
        by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what 
        they have is not the original version, so that the original author's 
        reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced 
        by others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of 
        any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot 
        effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a 
        restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that 
        any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be 
        consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the 
        ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser 
        General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and 
        is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use 
        this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those 
        libraries into non-free programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a 
        shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a 
        combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary 
        General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the 
        entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General 
        Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with 
        the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it 
        does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General 
        Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less 
        of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages 
        are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many 
        libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain 
        special circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to 
        encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it 
        becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must 
        be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free 
        library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this 
        case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free 
        software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free 
        programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of 
        free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in 
        non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU 
        operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating 
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the 
        users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is 
        linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run 
        that program using a modified version of the Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
        modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a 
        &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The 
        former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must 
        be combined with the library in order to run.

        <a name="SEC3" href="#TOC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, 
        DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>0.</strong> This License Agreement applies to any software 
        library or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
        copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
        distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License 
        (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data 
        prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs 
        (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work 
        which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the 
        Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under 
        copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a 
        portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
        straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is 
        included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
        making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means 
        all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated 
        interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
        compilation and installation of the library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
        covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of 
        running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from 
        such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based 
        on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for 
        writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and 
        what the program that uses the Library does.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
        Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
        provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy 
        an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep 
        intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence 
        of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the 
        Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
        you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library 
        or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and 
        copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
        Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>a)</strong> The modified work must itself be a software 
          library.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>b)</strong> You must cause the files modified to carry 
          prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of 
          any change.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>c)</strong> You must cause the whole of the work to be 
          licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
          License.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>d)</strong> If a facility in the modified Library refers to 
          a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application 
          program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed 
          when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
          to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such 
          function or table, the facility still operates, and performs 
          whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

          <p>
            (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has 
            a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the 
            application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
            application-supplied function or table used by this function must 
            be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square 
            root function must still compute square roots.)
          </p>
          <p>
            These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
            identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
            Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
            works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
            apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
            works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a 
            whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of 
            the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions 
            for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each 
            and every part regardless of who wrote it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or 
            contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the 
            intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of 
            derivative or collective works based on the Library.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the 
            Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on 
            a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the 
            other work under the scope of this License.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>3.</strong> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
        General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the 
        Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this 
        License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public 
        License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version 
        than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has 
        appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do 
        not make any other change in these notices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that 
        copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all 
        subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the 
        Library into a program that is not a library.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a 
        portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or 
        executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided 
        that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable 
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 
        and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from 
        a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
        code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the 
        source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the 
        source along with the object code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5.</strong> A program that contains no derivative of any 
        portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by 
        being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the 
        Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
        Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library 
        creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it 
        contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the 
        library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 
        6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file 
        that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a 
        derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. 
        Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be 
        linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The 
        threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure 
        layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions 
        (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is 
        unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. 
        (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library 
        will still fall under Section 6.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may 
        distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. 
        Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, 
        whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.</strong> As an exception to the Sections above, you may 
        also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library 
        to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
        that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit 
        modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse 
        engineering for debugging such modifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the 
        Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by 
        this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work 
        during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the 
        copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 
        directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one 
        of these things:
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete 
          corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including 
          whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed 
          under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable 
          linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work 
          that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that 
          the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
          modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
          understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions 
          files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
          application to use the modified definitions.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism for 
          linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses 
          at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's 
          computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
          executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of 
          the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
          version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
          made with.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid 
          for at least three years, to give the same user the materials 
          specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the 
          cost of performing this distribution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by offering 
          access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
          copy the above specified materials from the same place.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received a copy 
          of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the 
        Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for 
        reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, 
        the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is 
        normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major 
        components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on 
        which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 
        the executable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
        restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
        accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 
        use both them and the Library together in an executable that you 
        distribute.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work 
        based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
        other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute 
        such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of 
        the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is 
        otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
      </p>
      <p>
        
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy of 
          the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other 
          library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the 
          Sections above.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined library 
          of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
          explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the 
          same work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, 
        or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
        License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, 
        or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate 
        your rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
        copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
        licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since 
        you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to 
        modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These 
        actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. 
        Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based 
        on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do 
        so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
        modifying the Library or works based on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any 
        work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
        license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or 
        modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not 
        impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
        rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
        compliance by third parties with this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>11.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
        allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited 
        to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
        order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this 
        License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. 
        If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your 
        obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, 
        then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For 
        example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free 
        redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly 
        or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it 
        and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the 
        Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
        any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
        apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
        circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
        patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
        such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
        integrity of the free software distribution system which is 
        implemented by public license practices. Many people have made 
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
        through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
        system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
        to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
        impose that choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
        be a consequence of the rest of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>12.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
        restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
        interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
        this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
        excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in 
        or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License 
        incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>13.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
        and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
        time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
        version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
        specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and 
        &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and 
        conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
        the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a 
        license version number, you may choose any version ever published by 
        the Free Software Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>14.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library 
        into other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
        incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. 
        For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
        write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
        for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving 
        the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
        promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>15.</strong> BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, 
        THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
        APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT 
        WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
        LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR 
        A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
        PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE 
        DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR 
        CORRECTION.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>16.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR 
        AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO 
        MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE 
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL 
        OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE 
        THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING

      </h2>
      <p>
        If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest 
        possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that 
        everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting 
        redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms 
        of the ordinary General Public License).
      </p>
      <p>
        To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It 
        is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most 
        effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should 
        have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full 
        notice is found.

        We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software (``FLOSS'') 
        applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client 
        libraries (the ``Program'') despite the fact that not all FLOSS

        Legal Terms and Conditions
      </h3>
      As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0 of the 
      GPL:

      <ol>
        <li>
          You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed entirely 
          from the Program and one or more works (each, a &quot;FLOSS Work&quot;) 
          licensed under one or more of the licenses listed below in section 
          1, as long as:<br>a. You obey the GPL in all respects for the 
          Program and the Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of 
          the Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program, and 
          which can reasonably be considered independent and separate works in 
          themselves,<br>b. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work 
          which are not derived from the Program, and which can reasonably be 
          considered independent and separate works in themselves,<br>i. are 
          distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses listed below, and<br>ii. 
          the object code or executable form of those sections are accompanied 
          by the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for those 
          sections on the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as the 
          corresponding object code or executable forms of those sections, and<br>c. 
          any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a Derivative 
          Work on a volume of a storage or distribution medium in accordance 
          with the GPL, can reasonably be considered independent and separate 
          works in themselves which are not derivatives of either the Program,

 		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 		       Version 2.1, February 1999

  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]

 			    Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

   We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

 		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

   A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

   The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)

   &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
     in the event an application does not supply such function or
     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
     its purpose remains meaningful.

     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
     root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

   However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the
library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

   When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
     uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
     to use the modified definitions.)

     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
     least three years, to give the same user the materials
     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
     than the cost of performing this distribution.

     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
     specified materials from the same place.

     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

   For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
     Sections above.

     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

 			    NO WARRANTY

   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

 		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     
     Copyright (C)   

     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Lesser General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

      &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      <a name="SEC2" href="#TOC1">Preamble</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
      share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are 
      intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to 
      make sure the software is free for all its users.
    </p>
    <p>
      This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some 
      specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other 
      libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your 
      libraries, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
      freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
      service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
      want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new 
      free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone 
      to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
      restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
      distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or 
      for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. 
      You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. 
      If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object 
      files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, 
      after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must 
      show them these terms so they know their rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the 
      library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission 
      to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that 
      everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If 
      the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its 
      recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so 
      that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
      authors' reputations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
      We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software 
      will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming 
      the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it 
      clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not 
      licensed at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary 
      GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. 
      This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain 
      designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary 
      one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is 
      the same as in the ordinary license.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that 
      they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to 
      a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without 
      changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is 
      analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, 
      in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, 
      a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public 
      License treats it as such.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public 
      License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, 
      because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that 
      weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the 
      users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the 
      libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to 
      permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while 
      preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free 
      libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to 
      achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it 
      as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is 
      that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
      modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a 
      &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The 
      former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only 
      works together with the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary 
      General Public License rather than by this special one.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SEC3" href="#TOC1">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, 
      DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>0.</strong> This License Agreement applies to any software 
      library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other 
      authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this 
      Library General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each 
      licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>
      A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data 
      prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs 
      (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which 
      has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; 
      means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: 
      that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either 
      verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into 
      another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without 
      limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
      modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the 
      source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
      definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
      installation of the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
      covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running 
      a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a 
      program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
      Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing 
      it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the 
      program that uses the Library does.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
      Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
      provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy 
      an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
      all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
      warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
      you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or 
      any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
      and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 
      above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
      <!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>a)</strong> The modified work must itself be a software 
        library.

        <p>
          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>b)</strong> You must cause the files modified to carry 
        prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of 
        any change.

        <p>
          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>c)</strong> You must cause the whole of the work to be 
        licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this 
        License.

        <p>
          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>d)</strong> If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
        function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program 
        that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the 
        facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure 
        that, in the event an application does not supply such function or 
        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its 
        purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to 
        compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined 
        independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that 
        any application-supplied function or table used by this function must 
        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root 
        function must still compute square roots.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and 
      can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
      sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on 
      the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this 
      License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
      whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
      your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
      collective works based on the Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library 
      with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a 
      storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the 
      scope of this License.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3.</strong> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
      General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the 
      Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this 
      License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, 
      version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 
      2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can 
      specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change 
      in these notices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that 
      copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all 
      subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the 
      Library into a program that is not a library.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a 
      portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or 
      executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that 
      you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
      above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
      designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
      code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the 
      source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the 
      source along with the object code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>5.</strong> A program that contains no derivative of any portion 
      of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
      compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. 
      Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and 
      therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates 
      an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains 
      portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. 
      The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states 
      terms for distribution of such executables.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file 
      that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a 
      derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. 
      Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked 
      without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold 
      for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure 
      layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten 
      lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is 
      unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. 
      (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library 
      will still fall under Section 6.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may 
      distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. 
      Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether 
      or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6.</strong> As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
      compile or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to 
      produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that 
      work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit 
      modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse 
      engineering for debugging such modifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the 
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by 
      this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during 
      execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright 
      notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the 
      user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
      <!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 
        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with 
        the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the 
        Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can 
        modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable 
        containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who 
        changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not 
        necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified 
        definitions.)

        <p>
          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>b)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for 
        at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in 
        Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing 
        this distribution.

        <p>
          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>c)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by offering 
        access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
        copy the above specified materials from the same place.

        <p>
          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>d)</strong> Verify that the user has already received a copy 
        of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; 
      must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the 
      executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code 
      distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
      either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, 
      kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, 
      unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions 
      of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the 
      operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them 
      and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work 
      based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
      other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute 
      such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the 
      work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is 
      otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
      <!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->
      
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy of the 
        same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
        facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections 
        above.

        <p>
          
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined library of 
        the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
        explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
        work.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
      distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. 
      Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
      distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your 
      rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
      rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses 
      terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>9.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since 
      you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to 
      modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions 
      are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by 
      modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the 
      Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all 
      its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the 
      Library or works based on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>10.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
      based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license 
      from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the 
      Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any 
      further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted 
      herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
      parties to this License.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>11.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or 
      allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited 
      to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
      order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this 
      License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If 
      you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations 
      under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
      consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a 
      patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the 
      Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
      you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would 
      be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
      any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
      apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
      patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
      such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
      integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented 
      by public license practices. Many people have made generous 
      contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that 
      system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to 
      the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute 
      software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
      choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be 
      a consequence of the rest of this License.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>12.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
      restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
      interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
      this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation 
      excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or 
      among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License 
      incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>13.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised 
      and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to 
      time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
      version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
      specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any 
      later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and 
      conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
      the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license 
      version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free 
      Software Foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>14.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library 
      into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible 
      with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software 
      which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free 
      Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision 
      will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all 
      derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse 
      of software generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>15.</strong> BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, 
      THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
      APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
      HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT 
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
      LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF 
      THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME 
      THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>16.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR 
      AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO 
      MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE 
      TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
      LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 
      RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
      FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH 
      HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
      DAMAGES.

      <a name="SEC4" href="#TOC1">How to Apply These Terms to Your New 
      Libraries</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest 
      possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that 
      everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting 
      redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of 
      the ordinary General Public License).
    </p>
    <p>
      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is 
      safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most 
      effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have 
      at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is 
      found.
    </p>
