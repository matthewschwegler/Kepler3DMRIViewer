Description: Kepler is a scientific workflow system.
  Kepler can operate on data stored in a variety of formats, locally and
  over the internet, and is an effective environment for integrating
  disparate software components, such as merging "R" scripts with
  compiled "C" code, or facilitating remote, distributed execution of
  models. Using Kepler's graphical user interface, users simply select
  and then connect pertinent analytical components and data sources to
  create a "scientific workflow", an executable representation of the
  steps required to generate results. The Kepler software helps users
  share and reuse data, workflows, and components developed by the
  scientific community to address common needs.
