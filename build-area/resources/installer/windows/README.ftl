<h3>Overview</h3>
<hr>
<p>
Scientists in a variety of disciplines (e.g., biology, ecology, astronomy) need
access to scientific data and flexible means for executing complex analyses on
those data. Such analyses can be captured as 'scientific workflows' in which the
flow of data from one analytical step to another is captured in a formal
workflow language. The Kepler project's overall goal is to produce an
open-source scientific workflow system that allows scientists to design
scientific workflows and execute them efficiently using emerging Grid-based
approaches to distributed computation.
</p>
<p>
Kepler is currently based on the Ptolemy II system for heterogeneous, concurrent
modeling and design.  This version of Kepler is based on Ptolemy II version 
9.1.  Ptolemy II was developed by the members of the Ptolemy
project at UC Berkley. Although not originally intended for scientific
workflows, it provides a mature platform for building and executing workflows,
and supports multiple models of computation. For more information on Ptolemy II
and for detailed documentation that is applicable to Kepler, see the Ptolemy web
site at <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/">http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Kepler project is a cross-project collaboration to develop open source tools
for Scientific Workflows. The project was initiated by members of the Science
Environment for Ecological Knowledge Project (SEEK) and the Scientific Data
Management (SDM) projects by researchers at the National Center for Ecological
Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS, UC Santa Barbara) and the San Diego Supercomputer
Center (SDSC, UC San Diego). It has since attracted contributions from many
projects across many scientific disciplines (see 
<a href="http://kepler-project.org">http://kepler-project.org</a> for
the current list of sponsoring projects).
</p>
<p>
Kepler is an open-source project. Contributing members jointly determine the
goals for Kepler as well as contribute to the design and implementation of the
software system. We welcome contributions and encourage other people and
projects to join as contributing members.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<hr>
<p>
See the "Help" menu for detailed documentation.  Installation information can 
be found in the INSTALL.txt file in the root of the kepler directory.
</p>
<p>
Note that Kepler is built using Ptolemy II from UC Berkeley. Please check the
Ptolemy web site 
(<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII">http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII</a>) for details and
documentation. Ptolemy source code is included with this release inside the
kepler.jar file, and Ptolemy documentation is inside the
ptII/build/ptolemy-doc.jar. (jar files can be opened with WinZip or any other
software for unzipping compressed files.)
</p>

<h3>How to Start Kepler</h3>
<hr>
<p>
When using the application installers, there are different launchers for each
operating system.  On Mac OS X, Kepler is placed, by default, in 
/Applications.  You can navigate there after the installer completes
and drag the Kepler icon to the dock for easy execution.  On Windows, the
installer will give you an option to create an icon in your start menu and/or
on the desktop.  On Linux, navigate to your installation directory and launch
the kepler.sh shell script.  
</p>

<h3>Mac Users</h3>
<hr>
<p>
Currently, Macintosh version of several platform specific applications do not
exist for non-Intel Macs (e.g. GDAL code). Thus certain workflows that call
these applications will not run on older Macs. The RExpression actor has been
modified to always create PDF graphics files which are displayed using the
Macintosh Preview application.
