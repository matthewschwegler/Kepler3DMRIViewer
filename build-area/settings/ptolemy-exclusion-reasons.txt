For resources about what to exclude, see
ptII/.classpath.in and ptII/.classpath.default
These two files are used to configure Eclipse.

.classpath.in is processed by configure and appropriate
substitutions are made.

.classpath.default may be used without changes in Eclipse

See also ptII/adm/gen-7.2/src.ex, which is used to build nightly
builds.

In ptII/makefile, the CLEAN_SHIPPING_FILES variable lists files
that should not be shipped.  See ptII/doc/coding/releasemgt.htm
for details.

(1)
Exclusion: 
ptolemy/actor/lib/x10/**

Reason: 
Depends on code that is licensed GPL.

cxh: In Ptolemy, this code is conditionally compiled
if the GPL'd library cannot be found.  Ideally, we
would do a similar check at compile time?
However, this code is used very little, so it is fine
to exclude it.

(2)
Exclusion:
ptolemy/apps/**

Old Exclusion:
ptolemy/apps/charon/Agent.java
ptolemy/apps/charon/CharonCodeGenerator.java
ptolemy/apps/charon/CharonProcessor.java
ptolemy/apps/vergil/graph/MetaGraphController.java
ptolemy/apps/vergil/graph/MetaGraphTableau.java
ptolemy/apps/vergil/graph/MetaNodeController.java
ptolemy/apps/vergil/graph/MetaNodeRenderer.java
ptolemy/apps/vergil/graph/TestNodeRenderer.java
ptolemy/apps/vergil/graph/render/FigureSource.java
ptolemy/apps/vergil/graph/util/FigureToken.java
ptolemy/apps/vergil/graph/util/MouseEventToken.java
ptolemy/apps/fullscreen/sun/**
ptolemy/apps/zaurus/demo/HelloPP/HelloPP.java

Reason:
cxh: Actually, all code in ptolemy/apps can be excluded.
ptolemy/apps is for experimental code that is not shipped
with the Windows installer.  Instead, users should
include directories under ptolemy/apps as they need it.

Currently, in .classpath.in, we exclude the apps directories
by name because we are experimenting with Eclipse.  Also,
configure does checks for various missing pieces and includes
directories in apps as necessary.  

However, in the near term, excluding everything in ptolemy/apps is fine.

(3)
Exclusion:
ptolemy/backtrack/test/**

Reason:
The package of classes that these tests depend on are named incorrectly.

cxh: I'm not sure about this.  Excluding them is probably fine.
 
(5)
Exclusion
ptolemy/copernicus/kernel/fragment/**

Reason:
Excluded because of problems associated with Soot.

cxh: all of copernicus/kernel/fragment should be excluded.
