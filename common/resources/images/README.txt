Images in common are now in two different locations.  Images that need to be accessed from the classpath are in common/lib/images.  SVG images and icons are also still in lib/images.  This is just because I don't want to break anything major by moving them before the 2.0 release.  All other images and icons are now in resources/icons and resources/images.  Please put any new images or icons in the resources location.
